      <h2 >Origin and Background</h2>
      <p>Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over
        cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia
         which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern China and northern Myanmar.
         After plain water, tea is the most widely consumed drink in the world. There are many different
         types of tea; some have a cooling, slightly bitter, and astringent flavour,while others have vastly
         different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral, or grassy notes. Tea has a stimulating effect in
         humans primarily due to its caffeine content.</p>
      <h2 id = "B">Black Tea</h2>
      <p>Black tea, also translated to red tea in various East Asian languages,
        is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, yellow, white and green teas.
        Black tea is generally stronger in flavour than other teas.
        All five types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis,
        though Camellia taliensis is also used rarely.</p>
      <h2 id = "Y">Yellow Tea</h2>
      <p>It is an increasingly rare and expensive variety of tea. The process for making yellow tea is
        similar to that of green but with an added step of encasing. This allows the tea to oxidize at a slow
        rate for a short period before the tea is heated fully to denature the
        oxidizing enzymes, producing a far more mellow taste than is found in most green teas; this also gives the leaves
        a slightly yellow coloring during the drying process. Yellow tea is often placed in the same category
        with green tea due to its light oxidation. One of the primary aims of making yellow tea is to remove the
         characteristic grassy smell of green tea.</p>
      <h2 id = "G">Green</h2>
      <p>Green tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia sinensis leaves and buds that have not undergone the
        same withering and oxidation process which is used to make oolong teas and black teas.Green tea originated
        in China, and since then its production and manufacture has spread to other countries in East Asia.</p>
      <h2 id = "W">White</h2>
      <p>White tea may refer to one of several styles of tea which generally feature young or minimally processed leaves of the
        Camellia sinensis plant.</p>
      <h2 id = "O">Oolong</h2>
      <p>Oolong is a traditional semi-oxidized Chinese tea (Camellia sinensis) produced
        through a process including withering the plant under strong sun and oxidation before
        curling and twisting. Most oolong teas, especially those of fine quality, involve unique
        tea plant cultivars that are exclusively used for particular varieties. The degree of oxidation,
        which varies according to the chosen duration of time before firing, can range from 8 to 85%, depending
        on the variety and production style. Oolong is especially popular in south China and among ethnic Chinese
        in Southeast Asia as is the Fujian preparation process known as the Gongfu tea ceremony.</p>
      <h2 id = "D">"Dark" Post-Fermented Tea</h2>
      <p>Fermented tea (also known as post-fermented tea or dark tea) is a class of tea that has undergone microbial
        fermentation, from several months to many years. The exposure of the tea leaves to humidity and oxygen during
        the process also causes endo-oxidation (derived from the tea-leaf enzymes themselves) and exo-oxidation
        (which is microbially catalysed). The tea leaves and the liquor made from them become darker with oxidation.
        Thus, the various kinds of fermented teas produced across China are also referred to as dark tea, not be confused
        with black tea. The most famous fermented tea is pu'er produced in Yunnan province.</p>
